My research focuses on antibodies in neurological autoimmunity, the development of antigen-specific therapies for conditions like NMDAR encephalitis, and the prediction of disease risk using deep phenotyping and electronic health records. 
- I am a clinician-scientist with a dual background in Medicine and Mathematics. I did my clinical training at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
- I am a postdoc in <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu/team/nima-aghaeepour/" target="_blank">Nima Aghaeepour's lab</a> at Stanford.
- I am an incoming research group leader at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.

Please <a href="mailto:momsen.reincke@charite.de">reach out</a> if you are interested in neurological autoimmunity and want to work on exciting problems with real-world impact.
